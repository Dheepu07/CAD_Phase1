# Image Recognition System with  IBM Cloud Visual Recognition

## Project Objective

The Image Recognition System is a web-based application designed to recognize objects in uploaded images and generate AI-driven captions for these objects. The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Provide users with a user-friendly web interface for uploading images.
- Utilize IBM Cloud Visual Recognition to classify objects in images.
- Enhance user engagement and storytelling by generating natural language captions for recognized objects.

## Design Thinking Process

The project follows a design thinking approach to ensure a user-centric design and efficient implementation. Key design phases include:

1. Empathize: Understand user needs, including the desire for easy image recognition and storytelling.
2. Define: Clearly outline project objectives, features, and AI integration.
3. Ideate: Brainstorm ideas for the user interface and AI-generated captions.
4. Prototype: Create a functional web interface for image uploading and classification.
5. Test: Gather feedback and iterate to improve the system's usability and performance.

## Development Phases

The development of the Image Recognition System can be broken down into the following phases:

1. **Frontend Development**: Creating the web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Backend Development**: Implementing the image classification and caption generation using Python.
3. **Integration with IBM Cloud**: Connecting the system with IBM Cloud Visual Recognition for image classification.
4. **User Testing and Feedback**: Collecting user feedback and making necessary improvements.

## User Interface

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Key elements include:

- An image upload button.
- A display area for uploaded images.
- A section for displaying recognized objects.
- A section for AI-generated captions.

## Technical Implementation

The project combines frontend web development with backend AI implementation:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the web interface.
- Backend: Python for image classification and caption generation.
- IBM Cloud Visual Recognition API for image classification.

## Integration with IBM Cloud Visual Recognition

The system uses the IBM Cloud Visual Recognition API to classify objects in uploaded images. API key and endpoint configurations are set up to make API calls for image recognition.

## AI-Generated Captions

To enhance user engagement and storytelling, AI-generated captions are created for recognized objects. The natural language generation library is used to generate captions based on recognized objects.

## GitHub Repository

The project's code and files can be found in the GitHub repository: [CAD_Phase1](https://github.com/Dheepu07/CAD_Phase1.git).

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the Image Recognition System:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your IBM Cloud Visual Recognition API key and endpoint.
3. Run the backend Python script for image recognition.
4. Serve the frontend using a web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
